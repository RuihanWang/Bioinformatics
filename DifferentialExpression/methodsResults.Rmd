## Methods
  There are mainly two steps to do a differential express analysis.
  First we need to estimate relative abundance with salmon [@Raithel].
  Second we will apply statistical models to test the differential expression     between groups with tximport.[@Love]
  Then use DESeq2[@Albert] to test the results.


```{r, layout="l-body-outset"}
library(knitr)
deannotated <- read.csv("deAnnotated.csv", header = TRUE)
kable(deannotated)
```
